			* A new memory contract have been done for Theano for people that want to minimize memory copy.
		* We Deprecate the old Module system
		* No silent downcast of a theano function input by default.
		* Raise an error when using the result of logical operation on Theano varible in if (call to __nonzeros__)
		* Raise an error when we receive not aligned ndarray.(this is not supported)
		* Raise an error when DimShuffle receive bad configuration number.
		* Call numpy blas binding for gemv (We already linked with blas gemm)
		* If gcc is not enable by default fall back to the python version with a warning.

		* added erf and erfc fct.
	* Deprecate the current default value of the paramter axis of theano.{max,min,argmax,argmin,max_and_argmax}. We will use the same interface as numpy
