TRAC
    * Add a "Rename page" plugin
    * CoreTutorial:
        * In 0.2, rewrite as developer documentation of how theano.function works
        * For the time being, take the basic structure and make a
        "how theano.function works page", to be written, then remove
        CoreTutorial page.
    * When implementation of state is done, CompileFunction should be re-read.
    * Fix timestamp macro
        * Make sure [[Timestamp]] give us the timestamp when the timestamp was added
        * If behavior is different, then remove all instances of Timestamp
    * FrequentlyAskedQuestions
        * Move out of user docs, since it is not necessary
    * In the getting started page, make sure to have a link to the mailing lists.
    * GraphStructures
        * Needs an introduction.
        * Go over and make sure all documentation is current.
        * Need a short version of the page: What is a Graph, for Users
        * Longer version: Graph documentation, for Developers
    * Make sure we have a good sequential list of articles for newbies.
        * WhatWhyHow, merged with WhatIsTheano
        * Simple tutorial / walkthrough / cookbook
            * Use Tensor always, don't bother with Scalars
        * InstallationNotes
        * TerminologyGlossary
        === Maybe the following is more detailed user documentation, but not necessarily for newbies
        * What is a graph?
        * What is an Op?
        * How to Make Tensors
        * IntroToTypes
        * IntroToOps
    * GraphOptimization
        Rewrite. (Assigned to Pascal)
    * HowToDebug
    * HowToMakeOps
    * Fix up InstallationNotes page
    * Make a page TipsForSpeed
        * How to enable optimizations
        * How to have the correct BLAS library. [see installation page]
        * [Don't actually write this page, just indicate what should be written.]
    * OpWishList
    * ProposalCCodeGen
    * RandomNumbers
    * TensorVsScalar
    * Read over all "polished documentation" and make sure it looks good
    * Home page
        * Make sure that all wiki pages are included in the home page
        * Give a better summary of each wiki page
        * Section
            User docs
            Dev docs
            Proposals + discussions
            Historical proposals + discussion
    * Package 0.1 documentation, so we are free to update it
