Welcome
=======

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently. Theano features:

* **tight integration with numpy**
* **near-transparent use of a GPU** to accelerate for intense calculations [COMING].
* **symbolic differentiation**
* **speed and stability optimizations**: write ``log(1+exp(x))`` and get the right answer.
* **dynamic C code generation** for faster expression evaluation

Download
========

In April 2009 we made declared the creation of a `0.1 release <http://pylearn.org/theano/downloads/Theano-0.1.tar.gz>`_.
Development has continued non-stop since then.
The current version is available via::

    hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/theano Theano

The theano subfolder should be on your ``$PYTHONPATH``.  For more information about
installation and configuration, see :ref:`installing Theano <install>`.

Documentation
=============

You can download the latest `PDF documentation <http://pylearn.org/theano/theano.pdf>`_, rather than reading it online.

* If you have no idea what Theano is read the :ref:`introduction <introduction>`.
