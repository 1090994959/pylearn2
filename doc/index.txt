Theano

Theano is a Python library aiming to allow definition, optimization
and efficient evaluation of mathematical expressions involving
multi-dimensional arrays (though it may be extended to support many
other types). Theano melds some aspects of a computer algebra system
(CAS) with aspects of an optimizing compiler. This is particularly
useful in fields such as machine learning where complicated algorithms
must be run over large amounts of data.

Theano supports a wide range of numerical types in multiple
dimensions, a rapidly growing number of well-tested operations as well
as utilities to compute the gradient of an expression with respect to
another. Symbolic expressions may be compiled into functions, which
work merrily on the same data structures as numpy_, allowing for easy
interoperability.

Theano's compiler applies many optimizations of varying
complexity. These optimizations include, but are not limited to
constant folding, merging of similar subgraphs (to avoid calculating
the same values more than once), simple arithmetic simplification
(``x*y/x -> y``), inserting efficient BLAS_ operations and using
inplace operations wherever it is safe to do so. Theano also defines
several optimizations which improve the numerical stability of
computations and it provides a framework to add and test new
optimizers.

Theano was written at the LISA_ to support the development of
efficient machine learning algorithms while minimizing human
time. Theano was named after the `Greek mathematician`_ who may have
been Pythagoras' wife.

Getting started
===============

TODO: I want to bold the links below. How the fuck do I bold links? ``**`link name`_**`` doesn't work! :(


:ref:`install`
  Instructions to download and install Theano on your system.


:ref:`basictutorial`
  Getting started with Theano's basic features. Go there if you are new!


:ref:`advtutorial`
  This tutorial is for more advanced users who want to define their own
  operations and optimizations. It is recommended to go through the
  :ref:`basictutorial` first.

Discussion about Theano takes place in the theano-dev_ and
theano-users_ mailing lists. People interested in development of
Theano should check the former, while the latter is reserved for
issues that concern the end users.

Questions, comments, praise, criticism as well as bug reports should
be submitted to these mailing lists.

We welcome all kinds of contributions. Our `task list`_ is full of
interesting ideas awaiting a champion.  If you have any questions
regarding how to extend Theano, please feel free to ask on the
theano-dev_ mailing list.
