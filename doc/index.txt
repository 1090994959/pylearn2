Welcome
=======

Pylearn2 is still undergoing rapid development. Don't expect a clean road without bump!
If you find a bug please write to pylearn-dev@googlegroups.com.
If you're a Pylearn2 developer and you find a bug, please write a unit test for it so
the bug doesn't come back!


Pylearn2 is a machine learning library. Most of its functionality is built on top of
Theano.

Pylearn2 Vision
===============

* Researchers add features as they need them. We avoid getting bogged down by too
  much top-down planning in advance.
* A machine learning toolbox for easy scientific experimentation.
* All models/algorithms published by the LISA lab should have reference implementations
  in Pylearn2.
* Pylearn2 may wrap other libraries such as scikits.learn when this is practical
* Pylearn2 differs from scikits.learn in that Pylearn2 aims to provide great flexibility
  and make it possible for a researcher to do almost anything, while scikits.learn
  aims to work as a "black box" that can produce good results even if the user does not
  understand the implementation
* Dataset interface for vector, images, video, ...
* Small framework for all what is needed for one normal MLP/RBM/SDA/Convolution experiments.
* Easy reuse of sub-component of Pylearn2.
* Using one sub-component of the library does not force you to use / learn to use all of
  the other sub-components if you choose not to.
* Support cross-platform serialization of learned models.
* Remain approachable enough to be used in the classroom (IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

Download
========

No PyPI download how. You must checkout the version in github for bleeding-edge/development
version, available via:

.. code-block:: bash

   git clone git://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn.git


There is dependency on Theano and the `old Pylearn <http://deeplearning.net/software/pylearn/>`_ project. You should also install them


Documentation
=============

Roughly in order of what you'll want to check out:

* :ref:`introduction` -- What is Pylearn2?
* :ref:`tutorial` -- Learn the basics.

Check out how Theano can be used for Machine Learning: `Deep Learning Tutorials <http://www.deeplearning.net/tutorial>`_.

Community
=========

* Register and post to `pylearn-dev`_ if you want to talk to the developers. We don't bite.

* Register to `pylearn2-github`_ if you want to receive an email for all changes to the GitHub
repository.

* Register to `theano-buildbot`_ if you want to receive our daily
  buildbot email. This is the buildbot for Pylearn2, Theano, Pylearn
  and the Deep Learning Tutorial.

* Ask/view questions/answers about machine learning in general at
`metaoptimize/qa/tags/theano`_ (it's like stack overflow for machine learning)

* We use the `github issues <https://github.com/lisa-lab/pylearn/issues>`_ to stay organized.

* Come visit us in Montreal!  Most of the developers are students in the LISA_ group at the `University of Montreal`_.
