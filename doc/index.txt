Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
efficiently evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays.

The latest release is version `0.1
<http://pylearn.org/theano/downloads/Theano-0.1.tar.gz>`_.
You can download the latest `PDF documentation

Choose your own adventure...
----------------------------

* You have no idea what Theano is and you read the :ref:`introduction
  <introduction>`.

* Convinced by the Theano staff's rhetoric that it is worthy of your
  time (you can hear them into the distance congratulating themselves
  on the success of their dishonest ploy - a lone puppy's
  heart-wrenching cry echoes behind you but is cut short by an
  outworldly screech and what might be the dripping sound of a bloody
  blade - you don't care, though, because Theano is wicked cool), you
  :ref:`install Theano <install>` and :ref:`learn the basics
  <basictutorial>`.

* Blinded by your newfound knowledge, you want to play God and
  :ref:`learn how to extend Theano <advtutorial>`. The Gods are
  pleased that they get to devour your soul for this heresy, but you
  ascertain that it is worth it.

* Decidedly, your thirst for Theano-related information is
  unquenchable! So there you are, reading about Theano's compilation
  :ref:`pipeline <pipeline>`. Little do you know that article could
  not have been made without the tears of a thousand innocent kittens.

* You descend into madness as you read detailed (or as-of-yet not
  written, but our plans for world domination as well as the hourly
  sacrifices that our God requires leave us little time for writing)
  articles about :ref:`op`, :ref:`type`, :ref:`function`,
  :ref:`module`, :ref:`compilation`, :ref:`optimization`, :ref:`env`
  and as you consult the list of :ref:`envfeaturelist`. Sometimes you
  check the :ref:`glossary` just in case you missed an important
  concept.

* Requiring help in your dark endeavors, you register and post to the
  `theano-users`_ mailing list and curious to know who is behind this
  witchery and how their wicked plans come into fruition, you read the
  `theano-dev`_ mailing list.

* Mistaking your feverish sweat for genuine excitation, you
  investigate `Theano's Trac <trac/>`__ for tickets_ that your feeble
  mind might comprehend and your consumed brain is yearning to solve.

* Bored a Friday evening, you browse `Theano's API <api/>`__. May
  the Great Ones help you with that one.
