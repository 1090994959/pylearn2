Welcome
=======

Theano is a Python library that allows you to define, optimize, and
evaluate mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional
arrays efficiently. Theano features:

* **tight integration with numpy** -- Use `numpy.ndarray` in Theano-compiled functions.
* **near-transparent use of a GPU** -- Accelerate data-intensive calculations [JAN 2010].
* **symbolic differentiation** -- Let Theano do your derivatives.
* **speed and stability optimizations** -- Get the right answer for ``log(1+x)`` even when ``x`` is really tiny.
* **dynamic C code generation** -- Evaluate expressions faster.
* **extensive testing and self-verification** -- We take correctness seriously.

Theano has been powering large-scale computationally intensive scientific investigations
since 2007.  But it is also approachable enough to be used in the classroom
(IFT6266 at the University of Montreal).

Download
========

We recommend the latest development version, available via::

    hg clone http://hg.assembla.com/theano Theano

The theano subfolder should be on your ``$PYTHONPATH``.  For more information about
installation and configuration, see :ref:`installing Theano <install>`.

Documentation
=============

Roughly in order of what you'll want to check out:

* :ref:`introduction` -- What is Theano?
* :ref:`tutorial` -- Learn the basics.
* :ref:`libdoc` -- Theano's functionality, module by module.
* :ref:`optimizations` -- Guide to Theano's graph optimizations.
* :ref:`extending` -- Learn to add a Type, Op, or graph optimization.
* :ref:`internal` -- How to maintaining Theano, LISA-specific tips, and more...
* `API <api/>`_ -- The automatically-generated API

You can download the latest `PDF documentation <http://deeplearning.net/theanodoc/theano.pdf>`_, rather than reading it online.

Community
=========

* Register and post to `theano-users`_ if you want to talk to all Theano users.

* Register and post to `theano-dev`_ if you want to talk to the developers.

* We try to stay organized with `Theano's Trac <http://trac-hg.assembla.com/theano/report/1>`__ 

* Come visit us in Montreal!  Most of the developers are students in the LISA_ group at the `University of Montreal`_.
