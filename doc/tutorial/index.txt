Tutorial

Let's start an interactive session (e.g. ``python`` or ``ipython``) and import Theano.

>>> from theano import *

Many of symbols you will need to use are in the ``tensor`` subpackage
of Theano. Let's import that subpackage under a handy name. I like
``T`` (and many tutorials use this convention).

>>> import theano.tensor as T

If that worked you're ready for the tutorial, otherwise check your
installation (see :ref:`install`).
