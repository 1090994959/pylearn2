Let's start an interactive session and import the package you just
installed:

>>> from theano import *

Many of symbols you will need to use are in the ``tensor`` subpackage
of theano. Let's import that subpackage under a handy name. I like
``T``.

>>> import theano.tensor as T

If that didn't work, Theano is not installed correctly (see :ref:`install`).

Now we're ready for the tour:
