Basic Tutorial
==============

Before doing anything in this tutorial, make sure that Theano is
installed on your system (see :ref:`install`).


Done? Alright!


Let's start an interactive session and import the package you just
installed:

>>> from theano import *

Many of symbols you will need to use lie in the ``tensor`` subpackage
of theano. Let's import that subpackage under a handy name. I like
``T``.

>>> import theano.tensor as T


From then, here's the tour:


`Adding two numbers together`_
  Starting small

`More examples`_
  Getting comfortable

`Using Module`_
  Getting serious
