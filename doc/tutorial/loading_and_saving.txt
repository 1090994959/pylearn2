==================
Loading and Saving
==================

Many Theano objects can be serialized.  However, you will want to consider different mechanisms
depending on the amount of time you anticipate between saving and reloading.  For short-term
(such as temp files and network transfers) pickling is possible.  For longer-term (such as
saving models from an experiment) you should not rely on pickled theano objects; we recommend
loading and saving the underlying shared objects as you would in the course of any other python
program.

pickling -- Short-term serialization
=====================================

Pickling and unpickling of functions. Caveats... basically don't do this for long-term storage.

***TODO***

not-pickling -- Long-term serialization
=======================================

***TODO***

Give a short example of how to add a __getstate__ and __setstate__ to a class.  Point out to
use protocol=-1 for numpy ndarrays.

Point to the python docs for further reading.
