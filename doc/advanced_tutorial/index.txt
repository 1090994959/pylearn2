Advanced Tutorial
=================

Before tackling this tutorial, it is highly recommended to read the
:ref:`basictutorial`.


The advanced tutorial is meant to give the reader a greater
understanding of the building blocks of Theano. Through this tutorial
we are going to define one :ref:`type`, ``double``, and basic
arithmetic :ref:`operations <op>` on that Type. We will first define
them using a Python implementation and then we will add a C
implementation.

This tutorial should be of most use to users who want to extend Theano
with custom types and operations related to these types.
It is a good idea to read this tutorial as well since it provides
grounding for fundamental Theano concepts.
