******************************************


Why follow this Theano Boot Camp?
---------------------------------

 * *Explain why* Theano is a very usefull tool
 * *Teach* you Theano basic
 * *Show* how to use it on *recent machine learning* models
 * *Help you* build your first recent machine learning models in Theano
 * *If interest* can explain how to *easily extend Theano*

Boot Camp Overview
------------------

 * Day 1:
   
   * Overview/Motivation
   * ?!?!?show-of-hands regarding technical background questions
   * python/numpy crash course
   * Theano beggining
   * Example with recent ML models (DLT)
 * Day 2:
   * Loop/Condition in Theano (10-20m)
   * Propose/discuss projects
   * For groups and start projects!
 * Day 3: 
   * Advanced Theano(30 minutes)
      *  Debuging, profiling, compilation pipeline, inplace optimization
   * Projects / General hacking / code-sprinting.
 * Day 4: *You choose* (we can split the group)
     * Extending Theano or 
       * How to wrap code in an op
       * How to use pycuda code in Theano
     * Projects / General hacking / code-sprinting.



day 1:
I think that I could cover those 2 pages:
 * http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/hpcs2011_tutorial/introduction.html
 * http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/hpcs2011_tutorial/theano.html
That include:
 simple example
 linear regression example with shared var
 theano flags
 grad detail
 Symbolic variables
 gpu
 benchmarck
