Theano Project Documentation Overview
=====================================

Documentation is broadly divided into two kinds: user documentation and
developer documentation.  

- `Using Theano` covers how to *use* what is already in the Theano library to
  build graphs and evaluate them.

- `Extending Theano` introduces how Theano works and explains how to add new
  data and expression types, as well as optimizations to accompany them.

- `Hacking Theano` introduces you to what's under the hood: the compilation
  process, the Env, C code generation.


Using Theano
============

- First of all, read the `n00b guide`_.  It is a cut-and-paste, tutorial-style intro to what Theano can do.

- Familiarize yourself with the `glossary of terminology`_.

- Join `theano-users`_.

- Learn to use the typelist_, and the oplist_.  These are the building blocks
  of theano expression graphs.

- Browse through some of the `Howto`_ recipes on the wiki.

Extending Theano
================

- Read about `How Theano Works <UserAdvanced.html>`__.  This introduces the
  major interface data structures: Op, Type, Result, Apply.

- Read about `Extending theano <extending.html>`__.

- How to make a new Op.

- How to make a new Optimization.

- How to make a new data Type.

Hacking Theano
==============

- `Get Started as a Developer <DevStartGuide.html>`__ by setting up mercurial, getting a few accounts,
  setting up your environment, and getting some background in mercurial, python,
  and numpy.

- Join `theano-dev`_ to participate in development discussion.

- Pick a task from the `task list`_, or suggest one on `theano-users`_.
  Features/ideas are generally discussed on `theano-users`_.   Technical
  discussions of how to actually implement something should be on
  `theano-dev`_.

- Browse `Theano's API <../api/>`__.

- Keep an eye on the `Mercurial Changelog <http://pylearn.org/hg/theano>`__.

- Send us your work as a patch to `theano-dev`_ or commit directly to the trunk.
