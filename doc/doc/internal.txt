How to build sphinx documentation
---------------------------------------

Let's say you are writing documentation, and want to see the sphinx
output before you push it.
Here is what you do it::

    cd Theano/doc
    # Make an HTML directory for the output
    mkdir html
    sphinx-build . html


How documentation is auto-built on push
---------------------------------------

When you push to the main repository, the following file is run::

   projects@lgcm:~/repos/theano/.hg/refresh-epydoc.sh

It calls ``epydoc`` and ``sphinx`` on the code.

*It would be nice to explain this stuff in a little more depth:*
 * Who calls refresh-epydoc.sh ?
 * What exactly does it do?
 * Where does the output go?
 * Can we get links about mercurial hooks?
 * What happens if two people push at the same time? Does documentation get clobbered?

pylint
---------------------------------------

Here is the autogenerated `pylint output
<http://lgcm.iro.umontreal.ca/auto_theano_pylint/pylint_global.html>`.

Pylint documentation is generated using pylintrc file: ``Theano/doc/pylintrc``

You can see a list of all `pylint messages
<http://www.logilab.org/card/pylintfeatures>`__.


TO WRITE
---------------------------------------

*There is other stuff to document here, e.g.:*
 * where the documentation is getting built, and epy.
 * How epydoc and sphinx are integrated
 * The nightly build process.
 * We also want examples of good documentaiton, to show people how to write sphinx,
