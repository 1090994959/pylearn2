How to link from Sphinx to API documentation
--------------------------------------------

Link from Sphinx to epydoc this way::

    :api:`linkname <path-to-symbol>`

For example::

    :api:`function <theano.compile.function>`

You can also use ``:api:\`path-to-symbol\``` directly.

If you are lazy, you can try::

    :api:`<function>`

However, if the link target is ambiguous, Sphinx will generate errors.

NB the ``:api:`` reference is special magic by Olivier, in
./scripts/docgen.py.

How to add TODO comments in Sphinx documentation
-------------------------------------------------

To include a TODO comment in Sphinx documentation, use an indented block as
follows::

    .. TODO: This is a comment.
    .. You have to put .. at the beginning of every line :(
    .. These lines should all be indented.

It will not appear in the output generated.

    .. TODO: Check it out, this won't appear.
    .. Nor will this.

How to write API documentation
---------------------------------------

API documentation is processed by `epydoc
<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`__ and should be written in
`reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`__. See `here
<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-othermarkup.html#restructuredtext>`__
for details about how to use reST with epydoc documentation.

How to build documentation
---------------------------------------

Let's say you are writing documentation, and want to see
the `epydoc <http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>`__ and `sphinx
<http://sphinx.pocoo.org/>`__ output before you push it.

The following technique uses Olivier's code to insert :api: links::

    cd Theano/
    python ./scripts/docgen.py

If you don't want to rerun epydoc, do the following::

    cd Theano/
    python ./scripts/docgen.py --rst



How documentation is auto-built on push
---------------------------------------

When you push to the main repository, the following file is run::

   projects@lgcm:~/repos/theano/.hg/refresh-epydoc.sh

It calls ``epydoc`` and ``sphinx`` on the code.

*It would be nice to explain this stuff in a little more depth:*
 * Who calls refresh-epydoc.sh ?
 * What exactly does it do?
 * Where does the output go?
 * Can we get links about mercurial hooks?
 * What happens if two people push at the same time? Does documentation get clobbered?

pylint
---------------------------------------

Here is the autogenerated `pylint output
<http://pylearn.org/auto_theano_pylint/pylint_global.html>`__.

Pylint documentation is generated using pylintrc file: ``Theano/doc/pylintrc``

You can see a list of all `pylint messages
<http://www.logilab.org/card/pylintfeatures>`__.


TO WRITE
---------------------------------------

*There is other stuff to document here, e.g.:*
 * where the documentation is getting built, and epy.
 * How epydoc and sphinx are integrated
 * The nightly build process.
 * Explain the special magic in ./scripts/docgen.py
 * We also want examples of good documentaiton, to show people how to write sphinx,
