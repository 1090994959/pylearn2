Advanced Tutorial
=================

Before tackling this tutorial, it is highly recommended to read the
:ref:`basictutorial`.


The advanced tutorial is meant to give the reader a greater
understanding of the building blocks of Theano by making him or her
define a framework for basic arithmetic on doubles from scratch, as
well as custom optimizations for this system. This tutorial should be
of most use to users who want to extend Theano with custom types and
operations related to these types. Users who want to extend Theano
with new operations on tensors should check the
:ref:`tensoroptutorial`, but it is a good idea to read this tutorial
as well since it probably provides better grounding for the many
concepts at work here.
