Advanced Tutorial
=================

Before tackling this tutorial, it is highly recommended to read the
:ref:`basictutorial`.


The advanced tutorial is meant to give the reader a greater
understanding of the building blocks of Theano. Through this tutorial
we are going to define one :ref:`type`, ``double``, and basic
arithmetic :ref:`operations <op>` on that Type. We will first define
them using a Python implementation and then we will add a C
implementation.

This tutorial should be of most use to users who want to extend Theano
with custom types and operations related to these types. Users who
want to extend Theano with new operations on tensors should check
:ref:`tensoroptutorial`, but it is a good idea to read this tutorial
as well since it probably provides better grounding for the many
concepts at work here.
