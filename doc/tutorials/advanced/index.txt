Advanced Tutorial
=================

Before tackling this tutorial, it is highly recommended to read the
:ref:`basictutorial`.


The advanced tutorial is meant to give the reader a greater
understanding of the building blocks of Theano. It contains two
examples which cover most of the conceptual space associated with
:ref:`type` and :ref:`op` and then expands on other important matters
such as optimization.


This tutorial should be of most use to users who want to extend Theano
with custom types and operations related to these types. Users who
want to extend Theano with new operations on tensors should check
:ref:`tensoroptutorial`, but it is a good idea to read this tutorial
as well since it probably provides better grounding for the many
concepts at work here.
