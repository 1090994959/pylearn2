Using DebugMode
===============


The DebugMode evaluation mode (available via ``mode='DEBUG_MODE'``, :api:`DebugMode`) includes a number of
self-checks and assertions that 
can help to diagnose several kinds of programmer
errors that can lead to incorrect output.

It is much slower to evaluate a function or method in DEBUG_MODE than it would
be in FAST_RUN or even FAST_COMPILE, so it is recommended to use it during
development, but not when you launch 1000 nearly-identical processes on a
cluster.

DebugMode is easy to use:

.. code-block::

    x = theano.dvector('x')

    f = theano.function(x, 10*x, mode='DEBUG_MODE')

    f(5) 
    f(0) 
    f(7) 


If any problem is detected, at either call time (e.g. ``f(5)``) or compile time
(e.g ``f = theano.function(x, 10*x, mode='DEBUG_MODE')``) then DebugMode will
raise an exception according to what went wrong.   None of these exceptions is
OK to ignore; talk to you your local Theano guru if you can't make the exception
go away.

Some kinds of errors can only be detected for certain input value combinations.
In the example above, there is no way to guarantee that a future call to say,
``f(-1)`` won't cause a problem.  DebugMode is no silver bullet.


BadCLinkerOutput
----------------

This really just means that python and c didn't match.  The problem might be a
bug in either python or c or both.

BadOptimization
---------------

This happens when ... WRITEME.

BadDestroyMap
-------------

This happens when an Op's perform() or c_code() modifies an input that it wasn't
supposed to.
For detailed documentation see :api:`BadDestroyMap`.


BadViewMap
----------
This happens when ... WRITEME.


StochasticOrder
---------------

This happens when ... WRITEME.

FloatError
----------

This happens when ... WRITEME.

InvalidValueError
-----------------

This happens when ... WRITEME.


DebugModeError
--------------

This is a generic error, pretty unhelpful.  You'll generally have to look at the
stack trace and then in the code to figure out why DebugMode is complaining.
