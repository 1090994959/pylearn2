Thinking in Theano
==================

Theano offers quite a bit of flexibility.
How should you write your algorithm to make the most of what Theano can do?

A few tips
----------

- Remember that your code builds a graph that theano compiles, and you cannot
  literally put loops into that graph.

- Remember that Variables are symbolic of computations, not
  storage.  It does not make sense to *reassign* to a Variable.


Limitations
-----------

- Conditional control flow is possible but not efficient.  In essence, both
  sides of an if (see ``switch``) will be evaluated.

- Loops are not supported, but soon will be.
  (A ``scan`` op is in the works, but not included yet.)

- Recursion is not supported within a graph.


A few examples
--------------

**DO WE WANT SOMETHING HERE?**

These are intended to illustrate good ways of formulating an algorithm for
Theano.
For complete, usable implementations of these algorithms see WRITEME.
