OUTDATED(was for mammouth1, should be updated for mammouth2)
Use something like the following in your .bashrc:

.. code-block:: bash

    #use the intel math-kernel library for BLAS routines
    THEANO_BLAS_LDFLAGS=-lmkl

    # use up to two threads in the MKL routines
    OMP_NUM_THREADS=2

You may also need to run the following from your shell: 

.. code-block:: bash

    module add python      # for the current shell session 
    module initadd python  # for this and future sessions 

Lastly,  if ``./filename.py`` doesn't work, try ``python filename.py``.
