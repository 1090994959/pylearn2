    2D convolution implemented on GPU.
    Technically not a true convolution, as it does not flip the kernel.

    This is intended to be a very low-level, performance-oriented op.

    It will not try to fix the input for you. That would slow it down.
    The input must be in the right format. If not, it raises an exception.

    Currently, this op must be inserted manually, not by optimizations.


    images:          (channels, rows, cols, batch_size)
                     channels must be <=3, or be even
                     note: if you want to take the gradient with respect to the weights,
                           channels must be divisible by 4
    filters:         (input channels, filter rows, filter cols, output channels)
                     rows must be the same as cols
                     output channels must be a multiple of 16

    output:         (output channels, output rows, output cols, batch size)

    Note: all of these convolution routines are optimized for the case when
    the number of images (i.e. the minibatch size) is a multiple of 128.
    Other batch sizes will work, but Alex made no attempt whatsoever
    to make them work fast.
